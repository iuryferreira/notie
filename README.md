### âœŒ Hello!

Notie is a simple way to implement the Notification Pattern to notify your validations. A difference is that it is multi-purpose, so you can use it for notifications in any class or layer you want. Do what you want! ðŸ˜„

### ðŸ›  Install

Use the installation means below.

#### CLI (Linux/Windows/Mac)

To install via the command line (CLI), just run the following command in your project folder:

```bash
  dotnet add package Notie
```

#### NuGet packages managers (Windows/Mac/Linux)

Just search for "Notie" in your Visual Studio/Rider and click on add package.

### ðŸ’» Usage

Notie is intuitive and you can use the documentation provided by the code to help you, but I will also leave examples here.
